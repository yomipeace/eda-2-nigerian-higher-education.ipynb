# **Exploratory Data Analysis Project 2 (Nigerian Higher Education Institutions)**
A beginner exploratory data analysis project on Nigerian Institutions of Higher Education. 

# **Introduction** 
This project is meant to be a basic, beginner, level exploratory data analysis on data about Nigerian Institutions of Higher Education. Seemed like an interesting data set.

## **Data Sourcing/Credits**
The dataset used for this project can be found on Kaggle, **"Daily Power Generation in Indian (2017-2024)"**. This dataset was created by users **"Peace Adewumi, Omolola Okebiorun"** and **"Ayano Temitope"**.

### **Objectives:**
- Perform exploratory data analysis on the data set to find key insights.
- Perform data cleaning and data structuring to ensure data set is in good condition to work with.
- Create appealing graphs and images using Python that highlight findings and point out trends and patterns.

## **Data Description**
- **Namme**: name of the institution.
- **Year of establishment**: year the institution was established.
- **Ownership**: ownership of the institution (Federal Government, State Government or Private).
- **Category**: Category of institution (University, Polytechnics, Colleges of education, Colleges of Agriculture, Colleges of health, Vocational Enterprise, Specialized Institutions).

## **Exploratory Data Analysis**

Once the data had been cleaned and properly structured I moved on to plotting some key columns.

- These plots visually represent "Ownership" and "Category" over time.
  - This plot provides clear insights into the nature of ownership, and category of Nigerian Higher Education Institutions that I've eloborated on at the end of this document.

- This next splot vizualizes the share of each institution type that each owner (private, federal or state government) has.
  - Like the plot above, key insights have been expanded on at the end of this documnet.

- This pie chart visually represents percentage share of total institutions of higher education between each owner.

## **Insights**

- The vast majority of privately owned institutions of higher education began emerging after the year 2000. 
- Federal government investment/ownership of higher education institutions began increasing by the 1950's.
- The first institutions of higher education were government owned (state and federal), and they focused their resources on 'Specialized Institutions', 'Colleges of Health', and 'Colleges of Agriculture'.
- Owenership/investment in Colleges of Education level began in the 1950's and dramatically increased by the 1960's onwards.
- State government ownership/investment also increased dramatically by the 1970's.
- Innovation Enterprises and Vocational Enterprises began emerging around the 2010s.
- Investment in Universities saw a surge begining in the 2000's.
- Investment in Ploythenics began to increase by the late 1970's and remained steady.
- The majority of Nigerian institutions of higher education are Universities, Colleges of Education, Innovation Enterprises and Polythenics.
- 50% of Nigerian higher education institutions were created during the 24 years between 1993 to 2017.
- The first instituion of higher education was constructed in 1908.
- 25% of all institutions of higher education were created during the 85 years between 1908 to 1993.
- The other 25% of all institutions of higher education were created during the 6 year period from 2017 to 2023. There seems to be a clear acceleration of investment in Nigeiran institutions of higher education. This growth is being lead primarily by Private investors/owners.
- The vast majority of Universities, Colleges of Education, Ploythenics, and Innovation Enterprises are privately owned. State and Federal government takes the lead in terms of ownership of Colleges of Agriculture and Insitutions that offer NCE Programmes.
- 57.5% of all of Nigerias institutions of higher education are privately owned.
